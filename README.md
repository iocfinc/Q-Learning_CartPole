# Q-Learning_CartPole

Sample exercise from the Deep Reinforcement Learning module of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree. Using the Q learning model to train the agent to solve the cartpole environment of OpenAI gym. Mostly did hyperparameter changes to see its effects on the convergence and results of the agent's rewards during training.
